# Time Log

## What am I building?
A digital tool to help keep track of the tasks one needs to do. Helping with time blindness by having a way to keep track of how long a task is taking, and allowing users a way to easily see how long similarly named tasks took. Over time, this could give a good estimation of how long certain tasks take, making it easier to plan things out.  If memory is an issue, it is possible to follow the route as the Bullet Journal method, where the app is a way to temporarily hold things for people. Over time (maybe a set number of days) the item will be deleted. The idea is to have a digital temporary space to save things, then make time to put it into the the planner or journal as needed. Bonus points because it will be a good way for the items to be refreshed or cleaned up over time.
