A simple reading app that started out as so much more, but now this is what it is. For now, this is the starting point, I hope to come back to this and add more features as I get things sorted out. Looking back at some of the brainstorming ideas, it was a lot of little things in a project that didn't really go together.  For now, I will start with this app to help me keep track of what I'm reading. And who knows, maybe once I get all the features I want in this app, I'll branch out and try to implement some of the other ideas I had. 

As of 2025-05-14, it is a basic reading tracker that lets users add notes as they read. In the edit view, there are some details that I will make a note to go in to change, or re-do once I make a decision. 

In the future, maybe a way to rate the book, still on the fence about a full on review, since I don't like ranking or reviewing things.
