Decided to change the whole thing a little. Still keeping track of things, but decided to put a twist to it. There are a few things I want to be able to track. The idea of this is that it will be a tool to help with a planner. A way to quickly mark or keep track of how long it actually takes to do something. 
Most trackers, especially reading trackers, will note when you start and finish a book, but they don't often mention how long someone was reading for. Yes, with this app, the user is responsible to pushing the buttons, but it gives them an option to get a better idea of exactly how much time was spent reading. And for some works, it would be nice to be able to make quick notes about the story, just in case it is a longer story, or a book that someone has to keep pausing. 
Starting this project off with the to-do part because I feel like it would be a good basic class. Then I plan on adding the transit and book reading parts at the end.
